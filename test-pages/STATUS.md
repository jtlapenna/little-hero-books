   - Copy page06-test.html as template
   - Update:
     - Title
     - Background image path
     - Pose image path (in 3 places: CSS, debug info, img src)
     - Story text
   - Save as `pageXX-test.html`

2. **Position Characters**
   - Open each page in browser
   - Adjust positioning sliders
   - Enable flip if needed
   - Adjust lighting gradient
   - Copy CSS for workflow

3. **Missing Assets**
   - Generate page 12 background image
   - Determine page 12 pose (suggestion: walking or looking)
   - Determine page 13 character pose for reveal scene (suggestion: surprised-looking-up or hands-up-excited)

4. **Integration**
   - Export all positioning CSS
   - Update n8n workflow with final coordinates
   - Test end-to-end rendering
