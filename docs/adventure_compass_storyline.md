# MVP Storyline Concept: *The Adventure Compass*

This document outlines a lean MVP storyline for personalized children’s books. It balances templating and customization to create a magical, sellable product.

## Story Concept
**The Adventure Compass**  
A child discovers a magical compass that points them toward an adventure designed just for them. Each page follows the child as they journey to different locations (forest, mountain, sea, sky, etc.). At every stop, their unique traits and favorite things come into play. The story ends with the compass guiding them back home, where a dedication page ties the adventure back to the gift-giver’s love and wishes.

## Customization Opportunities
- **Child’s Name**: appears in the title and throughout story text.
- **Character Overlays**: hair, skin, eyes, clothing color.
- **Favorite Animal**: becomes a companion character.
- **Favorite Color**: featured in magical objects (e.g., “the glowing blue compass”).
- **Favorite Food**: woven into scenes (e.g., “They stopped for a picnic with strawberries”).
- **Hometown/Setting**: mentioned in opening or closing scene.
- **Dedication Message**: fully personalized note from gift-giver.
- **Occasion Toggle**: variants for birthdays, holidays, or milestones.

- **Total Word Count**: ~600–800 words.
- **Target Age Range**: **3–7 years old** (sweet spot for bedtime read-aloud keepsakes).
