# Little Hero Books - Story Specification & Personalization

## üìö The Adventure Compass Storyline

### Story Concept

**The Adventure Compass**  
A child discovers a magical compass that points them toward an adventure designed just for them. Each page follows the child as they journey to different locations (forest, mountain, sea, sky, etc.). At every stop, their unique traits and favorite things come into play. The story ends with the compass guiding them back home, where a dedication page ties the adventure back to the gift-giver's love and wishes.

### Customization Opportunities

- **Character Overlays**: hair, skin, eyes, clothing color
- **Favorite Animal**: becomes a companion character
- **Favorite Color**: featured in magical objects (e.g., "the glowing blue compass")
- **Favorite Food**: woven into scenes (e.g., "They stopped for a picnic with strawberries")
- **Hometown/Setting**: mentioned in opening or closing scene
- **Dedication Message**: fully personalized note from gift-giver
- **Occasion Toggle**: variants for birthdays, holidays, or milestones

### Structure

- **Page Count**: 14 interior pages + 2 covers = **16 pages total**

- **Total Word Count**: ~600‚Äì800 words

## üé® Personalization Strategy

### Visual Style
- **Watercolor storybook illustrations** are the most appealing and giftable right now
- They feel timeless, warm, and premium, which is important for keepsakes
- Alternative styles (flat 2D or modern hybrid) are less effective for print gifting

### Baseline Personalization (MVP)
- **Child's name** throughout the story and in the title
- **Basic character overlays**: hair color, skin tone, eye color, clothing color
- **Personal dedication page**: custom message from the gift-giver (e.g., "Love, Mom & Dad")

### Additional Enhancements for a Magical Touch

1. **Location/Setting Personalization**
   - Story references the child's city or hometown
   - Example: "In the magical forest just outside Grass Valley‚Ä¶"

2. **Favorite Things**
   - Dropdowns for favorite animal, color, or food integrated into the narrative
   - Example: "With a backpack full of strawberries, Luca set out to find the golden fox."

3. **Occasion Variants**
   - Editions tailored to events: birthdays, Christmas, first day of school, etc.

4. **Keepsake Elements**
   - Pages for child participation: handprint, drawing space, or photo insert
   - Turns the book into an interactive memory

### Premium-Level Customization (Future Expansion)
- **AI-generated persistent character likeness**: consistent across all illustrations
- **Expanded story personalization**: includes family member names, hometown landmarks, magical versions of favorite things
- **Deluxe dedication page**: decorative art and optional photo upload
- **Premium binding**: hardcover, gift packaging, and additional keepsake pages

## üìù Content Guidelines

### Story Requirements

- **Age Range**: 3-7 years old

- **Universal appeal**: "adventure" resonates across cultures and ages

## ‚úÖ **Recommendation**
