# ðŸ“˜ Decision Lock Timeline â€” Personalized Kids Book MVP

## Phase 1 â€” Foundations (Lock First)
**Decisions to Lock:**
- Story arc & length â†’ finalize narrative beats, number of spreads.
- Aesthetic / Style guide â†’ retro watercolor, paper texture, muted earth + bright accents (reference boards).
- Book specs â†’ trim, bleed, margins, page count, resolution, color space.

**Why Now:**
Everything else flows from story + style. These are the north stars.

## Phase 2 â€” Characters & Customization Scope
**Decisions to Lock:**
- Hero child design system â†’ base pose, swappable overlays (skin, hair, clothes, accessories).
- Customization boundaries â†’ what customers can change (name, skin tone, hair, favorite animal, favorite color).
- Fixed vs. customizable â†’ what will *never* change (story flow, backgrounds).
- Secondary cast (if any) â†’ fixed vs. modular.

**Why Now:**
Scoping the customer magic ensures MVP is achievable without uncontrolled asset sprawl.

## Phase 3 â€” Backgrounds & Scene Framework
**Decisions to Lock:**
- Scene list â†’ forest, sea, playground, etc., aligned to story beats.
- Slot planning â†’ child, animals, and accents positions.
- Background generation â†’ gpt-image-1 + Photoshop cleanup.

**Why Now:**
Backgrounds are heavy-lift assets. They must be aligned to story beats and customization slots before investment.

## Phase 4 â€” Typography & Fonts
**Decisions to Lock:**
- Font pairing â†’ playful yet legible serif/sans.
- Print testing â†’ kerning/legibility at POD size.
- Text placement rules â†’ margins, overlays, readability.

**Why Now:**
Typography ties story + art together. Needs to be set before renderer testing.

## Phase 5 â€” Supporting Elements

- Animals â†’ confirm 5â€“6 base animals.
- Accents â†’ sparkles, stars, glow effects (variants).
- Dedication frame â†’ final style and structure.

- Renderer integration â†’ manifest.json, slot coordinates tested.
- Digital proof â†’ overlays + text fit.
- Physical proof â†’ POD test for trim, bleed, color.
- Corrections cycle â†’ final adjustments before lock.

**Why Now:**

## Phase 7 â€” Launch Readiness
**Decisions to Lock:**
- Asset freeze â†’ no further changes.
- Documentation â†’ manifest, coordinates, archived style guide.
