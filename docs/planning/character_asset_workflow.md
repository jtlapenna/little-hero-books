# Character Asset Workflow - Pre-Generation Strategy

Here's a comprehensive workflow for generating **all** character + animal assets using AI + manual cleanup in a **pre-generation approach**. This ensures consistent quality, fast order processing, and reliable production.

## üéØ Core Requirements Recap

You'll need:

* **Base Character Assets**: Body poses (per scene) in each skin tone
* **Hair Overlays**: Head/face poses (per scene) in each skin tone + all hairstyles
* **Eye Overlays**: Interchangeable eye colors for each head pose
* **Animal Companions**: Multiple poses per scene
* **Quality Control**: Photoshop cleanup and standardization

**Key Change**: All assets are generated **before orders** and stored as prefab components. The renderer assembles existing assets rather than generating new ones.

## üß© Pre-Generation Pipeline Overview

Here's the high-level pipeline for generating all assets upfront:

1. **Setup Style Consistency**: Download Hugging Face embeddings and train LoRAs for character consistency and art style.
2. **Define Pose Templates**: Create skeleton + bounding boxes per scene (7 poses total).
3. **Generate Base Character Assets**: Body + head per pose + skin tone using LoRA + embeddings.
4. **Generate Hair Overlay Assets**: All hairstyles + colors per head pose using LoRA + embeddings.
5. **Generate Eye Color Overlays**: All eye colors per head pose using LoRA + embeddings.
6. **Generate Animal Companion Assets**: All poses per scene using LoRA + embeddings.
7. **Photoshop Batch Processing**: Clean up, standardize sizes, align bounding boxes using automated scripts.
8. **Quality Control**: Verify all assets meet production standards.
9. **Deploy to Asset Management**: Store in organized structure for renderer access.

## üîß Tools & Techniques

### **Style Consistency & Quality Control**
* **Hugging Face Embeddings**: Download pre-trained embeddings for watercolor children's book style and storybook illustration aesthetic.
* **LoRA Training**: Train custom LoRAs for character consistency (0.8 strength) and art style (0.6 strength) to maintain visual coherence across all generations.
* **ComfyUI Integration**: Use our updated workflow JSON with built-in LoRA and embedding nodes for automated, consistent generation.

### **Generation & Processing**
* Use **ComfyUI** (node-based) with our integrated LoRA + embedding workflow for consistent character generation. ([Journey AI Art][1])
* Use **ControlNet / pose guides** to enforce skeleton / pose constraints so the AI doesn't drift.
* Use **layered overlay approach** (97% fewer images) with separate body, hair, and eye overlays for maximum efficiency.
* Use a "master template" with fixed 1024√ó1024 bounding boxes so every generated asset fits consistently.
* **Photoshop Scripts**: Automated batch processing for alignment, cleanup, and standardization of all assets.

### **Quality Assurance**
* Use your stronger LLMs (GPT-5 etc.) to generate precise prompts with embedding keywords for consistent style application.
* Implement automated quality checks for dimensions, transparency, and positioning.
* **Batch Processing**: Process all assets through standardized Photoshop scripts.

## üìÖ Detailed Stepwise Workflow (Pre-Generation)

Here's the granular breakdown for generating all assets upfront:

| Stage                        | Input / Template                               | AI Generation                      | Output                                     | Notes                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Pose Template**         | Skeleton / stick figure + bounding box overlay | none (manual)                      | Template file for each scene               | Use fixed proportions, designate head box, body box, margin |
| **2. Base Character Assets** | Pose template + skin tone label + prompt       | Diffusion model (via ComfyUI)      | Transparent PNG: body + head (no hair)     | Generate per skin tone (4 tones √ó 7 poses = 28 assets)     |
| **3. Hair Overlay Assets**  | Base head + hairstyle prompt + hair color spec | Diffuse hair overlay (transparent) | PNG hair layers to drop onto head          | Generate all combinations (28 base √ó 7 styles √ó 5 colors = 980 assets) |
| **4. Eye Color Overlays**   | Base head overlay + iris prompt                | Diffusion or inpainting            | Transparent iris/eye color overlays        | Generate all combinations (28 base √ó 4 eye colors = 112 assets) |
| **5. Animal Companion Assets** | Scene prompt + animal pose spec                | Diffusion model                    | PNG animal overlay                         | Generate all poses per scene (7 poses √ó 3-4 animals = 21-28 assets) |
| **6. Photoshop Batch Processing** | All PNGs                                       | Photoshop scripts or batch actions | Corrected, aligned, same size, layer order | Fix clipping, shadows, alignment for all assets |
| **7. Quality Control**       | All processed PNGs                             | Automated + manual checks          | Production-ready assets                    | Verify dimensions, transparency, positioning |
| **8. Asset Deployment**      | Production-ready assets                        | File organization                  | Organized asset library                    | Deploy to renderer-accessible storage |

## üìê Precision & Scaling Strategies

* Always generate to a **fixed bounding box / canvas size**. E.g. 1024√ó1024 or whatever your renderer expects, with defined head/body area. This ensures alignment across assets.
* Use **mask + transparency control** to isolate hair, head, and body so layers don‚Äôt bleed.
* Use the same aspect ratio / DPI / resolution settings across all generations.
* Track metadata (scene ID, pose ID, skin tone, hairstyle, hair color, animal pose) in file naming or JSON manifest so automation downstream knows exactly which asset is which.
* When generating hair overlays, include **‚Äútransparent background, overlay only‚Äù** in prompt and optionally use negative prompts to avoid other elements.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Challenges

* AI drift: the model may change proportions or style subtly between generations; you‚Äôll need quality control and possible human cleanup.
* Hair + head alignment: hair overlays must match head shape and position exactly. Some mismatch may happen.
* Character consistency across scenes (especially when changing scenes/backgrounds) is nontrivial ‚Äî often you must reference a ‚Äúcharacter identity embed‚Äù or LoRA to maintain facial consistency.
* Animals: multiple animal poses may require separate tuning, and consistency across scenes is also tough.
* Eye color overlays: small details are harder for diffusion models to render cleanly; may require manual cleanup or vector overlays.

## üõ† Suggested Tools & Resources

* **ComfyUI** for structured node workflows and pose / prompt control. ([Wikipedia][3])
* **Scenario** for reskinning and color variant generation. ([Scenario][2])
* **Layer.ai** for production-quality 2D asset pipelines and variant generation. ([layer.ai][4])
* Use prompt engineering and embeddings (textual inversion / LoRA) to lock in your character‚Äôs identity across generations.
* Use Photoshop batch scripts or actions to align, crop, resize, and clean up your PNG assets.

## üöÄ Integration with Renderer

Once all assets are generated and processed:

1. **Asset Library**: Store all assets in organized structure (skin tone, hairstyle, eye color, pose)
2. **Renderer Integration**: n8n workflow selects appropriate assets based on order customization
3. **Assembly**: Renderer composites selected assets onto backgrounds
4. **Quality Assurance**: Automated checks ensure proper asset selection and positioning

This pre-generation approach ensures:
- **Fast order processing** (seconds, not minutes)
- **Consistent quality** across all orders
- **Reliable production** with no AI generation failures
- **Cost efficiency** (one-time generation vs per-order costs)
- **Scalability** for high order volumes

If you like, I can **draft a concrete prompt library** (templates for generating base body, hair overlays, animal poses) tailored to your art style and scene list. Do you want me to build that next?
