## 🎯 Current Status

**Amazon Integration**: ✅ **COMPLETE & READY**  
**Pre-Launch Testing**: ✅ **TEST BEFORE AMAZON ACCOUNT**  
**Next Step**: Test with mock data → Set up Amazon account when ready ($40/month)

---

## 🧪 **PRE-LAUNCH TESTING (Do This First - $0)**

### Overview
Before paying $40/month for an Amazon Professional Seller account, you can test the entire order processing workflow using **mock Amazon data**. All preparation work is complete and documented in the `docs/amazon/` folder.

### Test Now (No Amazon Account Required)

#### 1. **Mock Data Testing**
Use the mock Amazon data generator to simulate real orders:

📁 **File**: `docs/amazon/mock-amazon-data-generator.js`

```javascript
// Drop this into your n8n Workflow 1 "Generate Orders" node
const orders = [
  {
    AmazonOrderId: `AMZ-${Date.now()}-001`,
    PurchaseDate: new Date().toISOString(),
    OrderStatus: 'Unshipped',
    OrderTotal: { Amount: '29.99', CurrencyCode: 'USD' },
    ShippingAddress: {
      Name: 'Jane Smith',
      AddressLine1: '123 Main St',
      City: 'Portland',
      StateOrRegion: 'OR',
      PostalCode: '97201',
      CountryCode: 'US'
    },
    BuyerInfo: { BuyerEmail: 'test@example.com' }
  }
];

// Mock customization data (exactly as Amazon Custom returns it)
const customization = {
  'Child\'s Name': 'Emma',
  'Child\'s Age': '5',
  'Pronouns': 'she/her',
  'Skin Tone': 'Medium',
  'Hair Color': 'Brown',
  'Hair Style': 'Short/Curly',
  'Favorite Color': 'Purple',
  'Animal Guide': 'Unicorn',
  'Clothing Style': 'Dress',
  'Dedication Message': 'To Emma, with love!'
};

return orders.map(order => ({
  json: {
    order: order,
    items: {
      OrderItems: [{
        ASIN: 'B0LITTLEHERO001',
        SellerSKU: 'LITTLE_HERO_BOOK_CUSTOM',
        BuyerCustomizedInfo: {
          CustomizedInfo: customization
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}));
```

#### 2. **Test Complete Flow**

- ✅ Workflow 2A: Character generation (Bria AI)
- ✅ Workflow 2B: Character backup processing
- ✅ Workflow 3: Book assembly

```javascript
// Simple mock data
const mockOrders = [{
  amazon_order_id: 'TEST-ORDER-001',
  customer_name: 'Jane Smith',
  // ...
}];
```

**With This** (Mock Amazon-formatted data):
```javascript
// Import from mock-amazon-data-generator.js
const { generateTestOrderBatch } = require('./mock-amazon-data-generator');
const orders = generateTestOrderBatch(3); // Generate 3 realistic orders
```

## 🔄 Order Processing Flow

### Backend Flow Overview (Event Timeline)

**T0**: Amazon order placed → customization captured → order enters **Unshipped**  
**T0+5m**: n8n Flow A polls SP‑API → fetches order & items → extracts customization JSON  
**T0+10m**: Renderer called with manuscript + assets → returns book.pdf & cover.pdf URLs  
**T0+15m**: n8n submits POD order (ship method = Economy by default)  
**T0+15m → D+X**: Flow B polls POD for status → when tracking appears, confirm shipment on SP‑API  
**D+X**: Customer receives Amazon shipping email + optional buyer‑seller message

### n8n Workflows (Detailed)

#### Flow A — Order Intake & Job Creation (Cron 5–10 min)

1. **Trigger**: Cron
2. **Get Orders** (SP‑API ListOrders, Unshipped/PartiallyShipped, since last poll)
3. **Get Order Items** (pull customization fields)
4. **Validate & Normalize** (schema: child, options, shipping)
5. **Generate Story**: Use template system for personalization
6. **Assets**: Select prefab backgrounds; map overlays (hair/skin/clothes/colors/animal)
7. **Renderer**: POST /render → returns `bookPdfUrl`, `coverPdfUrl`, `thumbUrl`
8. **POD Order**: POST POD /orders with PDFs + ship‑to; receive `podOrderId`
9. **Persist**: Upsert to DB/Sheet: `orderId, podOrderId, status=submitted, pdfs, inputs`
10. **Notify**: Slack/Email: "Created POD job for Amazon order …"

#### Flow B — Tracking & Shipment Confirmation (Cron 30–60 min)

1. **Trigger**: Cron
2. **Fetch in‑flight jobs** (status ∈ submitted/in_production)
3. **Get POD Status** (check tracking)
4. **When tracking**: SP‑API ConfirmShipment (carrier, tracking, ship date)
5. **Update**: DB status → shipped; store tracking
6. **Notify**: Slack and optional buyer‑seller message

#### Flow C — Exceptions & Retries (On‑Error globally)

- Automatic retries w/ exponential backoff on HTTP nodes
- Dead‑letter to Notion/Sheet: orders needing manual review (bad fields, render fail)
- Alert channel: `#ops-personalized-books`

## 📊 Data Model (MVP)

**Order**: orderId, orderDate, marketplaceId, buyerMaskedEmail  
**CustomerInputs**: name, age, hair, skin, favColor, favAnimal, hometown, dedication, occasion  
**Files**: bookPdfUrl, coverPdfUrl, thumbUrl  
**POD**: podOrderId, status, shipMethod  
**Shipping**: name, address1, address2, city, state, zip, country, phone  
**Tracking**: carrier, trackingNumber, shipDate, deliveredDate?

DEBUG_MODE=true
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## 📈 SLAs & Policies

- **Order to POD submit**: ≤ 30 minutes average
