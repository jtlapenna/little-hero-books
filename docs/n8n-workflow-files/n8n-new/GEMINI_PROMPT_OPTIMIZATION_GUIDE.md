# üé® Gemini Prompt Optimization Guide
## Character Pose Generation - Incremental Improvement Strategy

---

## üìä Current Situation

**Problem:** Not all character images are being generated according to their pose references

**Root Cause:** Gemini is sometimes blending visual traits from both reference images instead of separating appearance (IMAGE A) from pose structure (IMAGE B)

**Goal:** 100% accurate pose replication while maintaining character appearance consistency

---

## üéØ Testing Methodology

### Before You Start
1. **Document baseline**: Run current workflow, note which poses fail and how
2. **Screenshot problem cases**: Save 2-3 examples for before/after comparison
3. **Track success rate**: Count how many poses out of 12 are accurate

### For Each Test
1. **Change ONE thing only**
2. **Run full workflow** (all 12 poses)
3. **Evaluate results**:
   - Did problem poses improve?
   - Did any good poses get worse?
   - Overall: Keep or revert?
4. **Keep if net positive**, revert if negative or no change
5. **Move to next test**

## üî¨ Improvement Tests (Priority Order)

---

## ‚úÖ TEST 1: Add Explicit Negatives
**Priority:** ‚ö° HIGHEST  
**Impact:** High - Directly prevents visual bleed-through  
**Difficulty:** Easy - Just add text  
**Test Time:** ~15 minutes

### The Problem
Gemini sometimes copies visual traits (skin tone, hair, clothes) from IMAGE B when it should only copy pose structure.

### The Fix
Add explicit "DO NOT" statements to create clear boundaries.

### Code Change
In the `promptText` section, add this **AFTER the existing MANDATORY APPEARANCE TRAITS**:

```javascript
const promptText = `ULTRA-CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
You must generate EXACTLY ONE image that combines:
- The EXACT character appearance from IMAGE A (skin tone, hair color, hair length, hair style, clothing, facial features)
- The EXACT body pose and position from IMAGE B (stance, limb positions, body angle)

MANDATORY APPEARANCE TRAITS (from IMAGE A - DO NOT CHANGE):
- Hair: ${characterSpecs.hairColor} ${characterSpecs.hairStyle} hair
- Skin: ${characterSpecs.skinTone} skin tone
- Clothing: ${characterSpecs.clothingStyle}
- Age: ${characterSpecs.age} years old

CRITICAL - DO NOT COPY FROM IMAGE B:
‚ùå DO NOT copy skin color from IMAGE B
‚ùå DO NOT copy hair color, length, or style from IMAGE B
‚ùå DO NOT copy clothing or outfit from IMAGE B
‚ùå DO NOT copy facial features from IMAGE B
‚ùå DO NOT copy any colors or textures from IMAGE B
‚úÖ ONLY copy the skeletal pose structure from IMAGE B

REQUIREMENTS:
- Style: Watercolor storybook illustration
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF) - NO transparency
- Output: Character from IMAGE A in pose from IMAGE B
- Ensure only ONE pair of legs, ONE pair of arms, and ONE head per character

Generate the image now.`;
```

### Expected Improvement
- Fewer instances of wrong skin tone
- More consistent hair color/style
- Better clothing accuracy
- **Estimated success rate increase:** +15-25%

---

## üéØ TEST 2: Add Generic Anatomical Framework
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Medium-High - Helps Gemini understand what "pose" means  
**Difficulty:** Easy - Add framework text  
**Test Time:** ~15 minutes

### The Problem
"Pose" is abstract. Gemini might not know what structural elements to extract from IMAGE B.

### The Fix
Teach Gemini what constitutes a pose using a generic anatomical framework.

### Code Change
Add this **BEFORE "MANDATORY APPEARANCE TRAITS"**:

```javascript
const promptText = `ULTRA-CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
You must generate EXACTLY ONE image that combines:
- The EXACT character appearance from IMAGE A (skin tone, hair color, hair length, hair style, clothing, facial features)
- The EXACT body pose and position from IMAGE B (stance, limb positions, body angle)

WHAT IS A POSE (Generic Structure - Apply to IMAGE B):
A pose is defined by skeletal body structure ONLY:
- Head: tilt angle, rotation, which direction it faces
- Shoulders: level, raised, or rotated
- Arms: position relative to torso, elbow bend angles, whether raised/lowered/extended
- Hands: placement, orientation, what they're doing
- Torso: upright/leaning, rotation angle, bend direction
- Hips: alignment, rotation, weight distribution
- Legs: stance width, knee bend, which leg supports weight, foot position
- Feet: direction, spacing, on tiptoes or flat

Extract ONLY this skeletal/structural information from IMAGE B.
Ignore all visual appearance from IMAGE B - no colors, no textures, no features.

MANDATORY APPEARANCE TRAITS (from IMAGE A - DO NOT CHANGE):
[... rest of prompt continues ...]
`;
```

### Expected Improvement
- More accurate arm positions
- Better weight distribution (which leg is forward, etc.)
- Improved torso rotation
- More faithful replication of complex poses
- **Estimated success rate increase:** +10-20%

### Notes
This is **generic** - you don't need to describe each specific pose. Gemini applies this framework to whatever pose is in IMAGE B.

---

## üí™ TEST 3: Strengthen System Instruction
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Impact:** Medium - Sets authoritative context  
**Difficulty:** Easy - Replace system text  
**Test Time:** ~15 minutes

### The Problem
Current system instruction is generic. A stronger, more authoritative tone may improve compliance.

### The Fix
Replace the system instruction with a more explicit, rule-based version.

### Code Change
Replace this:

```javascript
const systemText = `You are a precise illustration tool. CRITICAL: You must preserve the EXACT appearance from IMAGE A. IMAGE B is ONLY for body position - ignore ALL visual traits from IMAGE B. CONFLICT RULE: Always follow IMAGE A for appearance.`;
```

With this:

```javascript
const systemText = `You are a specialized character pose illustration system with strict operational rules:

RULE 1 - IMAGE HIERARCHY:
- IMAGE A = SOLE source for ALL visual appearance (hair, skin, clothes, face, colors, textures)
- IMAGE B = SOLE source for body structure/pose ONLY (skeletal positioning, no visual traits)

RULE 2 - APPEARANCE EXTRACTION:
From IMAGE A, extract and preserve: skin tone, hair color, hair length, hair style, facial features, clothing style, clothing colors, age appearance, proportions.

RULE 3 - POSE EXTRACTION:
From IMAGE B, extract ONLY: body position, limb angles, stance, weight distribution, head direction, skeletal structure.

RULE 4 - CONFLICT RESOLUTION:
If IMAGE B shows different appearance traits than IMAGE A, ALWAYS use IMAGE A's traits. IMAGE B's appearance is irrelevant.

RULE 5 - OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
Generate exactly one watercolor storybook illustration combining IMAGE A's appearance with IMAGE B's pose on pure white background.

Violation of these rules will result in generation failure. Strict adherence required.`;
```

### Expected Improvement
- More consistent rule following
- Better separation of concerns
- Reduced confusion on ambiguous cases
- **Estimated success rate increase:** +5-15%

---

## üîÅ TEST 4: Add Constraint Reinforcement
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Low-Medium - Reinforces key rules  
**Difficulty:** Easy - Add reminder at end  
**Test Time:** ~15 minutes

### The Problem
Long prompts can cause models to "forget" early instructions by the time they finish reading.

### The Fix
Repeat the most critical constraints at the END of the prompt.

### Code Change
Add this at the **VERY END** of `promptText` (after "Generate the image now."):

```javascript
const promptText = `[... all existing prompt text ...]

Generate the image now.

FINAL REMINDER BEFORE GENERATION:
‚úì All visual traits (hair, skin, clothes, face) come from IMAGE A only
‚úì Pose structure (body position, limbs, stance) comes from IMAGE B only
‚úì If IMAGE B shows different colors/textures, ignore them completely
‚úì Output: IMAGE A character + IMAGE B pose structure + white background`;
```

### Expected Improvement
- Better end-to-end consistency
- Fewer "last-minute" errors
- More reliable rule following
- **Estimated success rate increase:** +5-10%

---

## üå°Ô∏è TEST 5: Lower Temperature
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Medium - More consistent outputs  
**Difficulty:** Very Easy - Change one number  
**Test Time:** ~15 minutes

### The Problem
Temperature 0.3 allows moderate creativity, which can cause inconsistency in pose replication.

### The Fix
Lower temperature to reduce randomness and increase consistency.

### Code Change
In `generationConfig`, change:

```javascript
generationConfig: {
  imageConfig: { aspectRatio: "1:1" },
  temperature: 0.3  // Current
}
```

To:

```javascript
generationConfig: {
  imageConfig: { aspectRatio: "1:1" },
  temperature: 0.15  // Lower for consistency
}
```

### Expected Improvement
- More predictable outputs
- Less variation between similar poses
- Potentially more "literal" interpretation
- **Estimated success rate increase:** +5-15%

### Caution
‚ö†Ô∏è **Too low** (0.05-0.1) may make images look "stiff" or lose artistic quality  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Test range:** 0.15-0.2 is the sweet spot for consistency + quality

---

## ‚úÖ TEST 6: Add Verification Checklist
**Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Low-Medium - Theoretical benefit  
**Difficulty:** Easy - Add checklist  
**Test Time:** ~15 minutes

### The Problem
Models don't always self-verify their outputs before finalizing.

### The Fix
Add an explicit checklist that asks the model to verify critical requirements.

### Code Change
Add this at the **VERY END** of `promptText`:

```javascript
const promptText = `[... all existing prompt text ...]

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (Review before finalizing):
Before outputting the final image, verify ALL of these are true:
‚òê Hair color matches IMAGE A: ${characterSpecs.hairColor}
‚òê Hair style matches IMAGE A: ${characterSpecs.hairStyle}
‚òê Skin tone matches IMAGE A: ${characterSpecs.skinTone}
‚òê Clothing matches IMAGE A: ${characterSpecs.clothingStyle}
‚òê Age appears as: ${characterSpecs.age} years old
‚òê Pose structure matches IMAGE B
‚òê Background is pure white (#FFFFFF)
‚òê Only one complete character (no duplicates or extra limbs)

If any box is unchecked, regenerate until all are checked.`;
```

### Expected Improvement
- May catch errors before output
- Reinforces critical requirements
- Encourages self-correction
- **Estimated success rate increase:** +5-10%

### Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è This is **theoretical** - models don't always follow verification instructions. Test to see if it helps in practice.

## üîÑ TEST 7: Reorder Image Presentation
**Priority:** LOW  
**Impact:** Low - Experimental  
**Difficulty:** Easy - Swap image order  
**Test Time:** ~15 minutes

### The Problem
Presenting IMAGE A first might give it priority in the model's "memory."

### The Fix
Try different presentation orders to see which works best.

### Code Change Option A: Sandwich Method
Present IMAGE A, then IMAGE B, then remind about IMAGE A:

```javascript
contents: [{
  role: 'user',
  parts: [
    { text: 'IMAGE A ‚Äì PRIMARY REFERENCE (your source of truth for ALL appearance):' },
    { inlineData: { mimeType: "image/png", data: characterBase64 } },
    { text: 'IMAGE B ‚Äì POSE STRUCTURE ONLY (body position, ignore all visual traits):' },
    { inlineData: { mimeType: "image/png", data: poseBase64 } },
    { text: 'REMEMBER: Use IMAGE A for appearance, IMAGE B for pose structure.' },
    { text: promptText }
  ]
}]
```

### Code Change Option B: Emphasize Primary
Put IMAGE A twice:

```javascript
contents: [{
  role: 'user',
  parts: [
    { text: 'PRIMARY APPEARANCE SOURCE - IMAGE A (use for all visual traits):' },
    { inlineData: { mimeType: "image/png", data: characterBase64 } },
    { text: 'SECONDARY STRUCTURE SOURCE - IMAGE B (pose only, ignore appearance):' },
    { inlineData: { mimeType: "image/png", data: poseBase64 } },
    { text: 'PRIMARY APPEARANCE SOURCE REMINDER - This is IMAGE A again (your appearance source):' },
    { inlineData: { mimeType: "image/png", data: characterBase64 } },
    { text: promptText }
  ]
}]
```

### Expected Improvement
- May improve appearance consistency
- Experimental - impact varies
- **Estimated success rate increase:** +0-10%

---

## üìà Combined Strategy (After Individual Testing)

Once you've tested each improvement individually, combine the **most effective** ones:

### Recommended Combination (if all tests are positive)
1. ‚úÖ Explicit Negatives (Test 1)
2. ‚úÖ Anatomical Framework (Test 2)
3. ‚úÖ Stronger System Instruction (Test 3)
4. ‚úÖ Lower Temperature to 0.15 (Test 5)
5. ‚úÖ Constraint Reinforcement (Test 4)

### Expected Combined Impact
If all individual tests are positive:
- **Estimated total success rate increase:** +40-60%
- Should achieve 90%+ pose accuracy

---

## üß™ Testing Template

Use this for each test:

```
TEST #: [Test Name]
DATE: [Date]
BASELINE: [X/12 poses accurate before test]

CHANGES MADE:
- [List specific code changes]

RESULTS:
- Poses that improved: [List pose numbers]
- Poses that got worse: [List pose numbers]
- Net change: [X/12 poses accurate after test]

DECISION: ‚òê KEEP  ‚òê REVERT  ‚òê ITERATE

NOTES:
[Any observations about what worked or didn't]
```

## üìã Complete Example: Test 1 Implementation

Here's the **full updated code** for Test 1 (Explicit Negatives):

```javascript
// Prepare Gemini API request with character and pose images
const items = $input.all();
const results = [];

for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  const item = items[i];
  
  const characterBase64 = item.json.characterBase64;
  const poseBase64 = item.json.poseBase64;
  const currentPoseNumber = item.json.currentPoseNumber;
  const characterSpecs = item.json.characterSpecs;
  
  if (!characterBase64 || characterBase64.length < 100) {
    throw new Error(`Character base64 data missing or invalid for pose ${currentPoseNumber}`);
  }
  if (!poseBase64 || poseBase64.length < 100) {
    throw new Error(`Pose base64 data missing or invalid for pose ${currentPoseNumber}`);
  }
  if (!characterSpecs) {
    throw new Error(`Character specifications missing for pose ${currentPoseNumber}`);
  }

  const systemText = `You are a precise illustration tool. CRITICAL: You must preserve the EXACT appearance from IMAGE A. IMAGE B is ONLY for body position - ignore ALL visual traits from IMAGE B. CONFLICT RULE: Always follow IMAGE A for appearance.`;

  const promptText = `ULTRA-CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
You must generate EXACTLY ONE image that combines:
- The EXACT character appearance from IMAGE A (skin tone, hair color, hair length, hair style, clothing, facial features)
- The EXACT body pose and position from IMAGE B (stance, limb positions, body angle)

MANDATORY APPEARANCE TRAITS (from IMAGE A - DO NOT CHANGE):
- Hair: ${characterSpecs.hairColor} ${characterSpecs.hairStyle} hair
- Skin: ${characterSpecs.skinTone} skin tone
- Clothing: ${characterSpecs.clothingStyle}
- Age: ${characterSpecs.age} years old

CRITICAL - DO NOT COPY FROM IMAGE B:
‚ùå DO NOT copy skin color from IMAGE B
‚ùå DO NOT copy hair color, length, or style from IMAGE B
‚ùå DO NOT copy clothing or outfit from IMAGE B
‚ùå DO NOT copy facial features from IMAGE B
‚ùå DO NOT copy any colors or textures from IMAGE B
‚úÖ ONLY copy the skeletal pose structure from IMAGE B

REQUIREMENTS:
- Style: Watercolor storybook illustration
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF) - NO transparency
- Output: Character from IMAGE A in pose from IMAGE B
- Ensure only ONE pair of legs, ONE pair of arms, and ONE head per character

Generate the image now.`;

  const requestBody = {
    systemInstruction: {
      role: 'system',
      parts: [{ text: systemText }]
    },
    contents: [{
      role: 'user',
      parts: [
        { text: 'IMAGE A ‚Äì CHARACTER REFERENCE (your source of truth for appearance):' },
        { inlineData: { mimeType: "image/png", data: characterBase64 } },
        { text: 'IMAGE B ‚Äì POSE REFERENCE (body position ONLY, ignore character appearance):' },

        { text: promptText }
      ]
    }],
    generationConfig: {
      imageConfig: { aspectRatio: "1:1" },
      temperature: 0.3
    }
  };

  results.push({
    json: {
      ...item.json,
      requestBody: requestBody
    }
  });
}

return results;
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

Track these for each test:

**Quantitative:**
- Poses accurate: X/12
- Improvement from baseline: +X%
- Average quality score: 1-10

**Qualitative:**
- Hair accuracy: Better/Same/Worse
- Skin tone accuracy: Better/Same/Worse
- Clothing accuracy: Better/Same/Worse
- Pose structure accuracy: Better/Same/Worse

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Test one at a time** - Don't combine changes until you know which work
2. **Document everything** - You'll want to know what worked later
3. **Be patient** - Each test takes ~15 minutes (workflow runtime)
4. **Watch for regressions** - Sometimes a change helps some poses but hurts others
5. **Gemini updates** - Google updates models periodically; what works now may need adjustment later

---
