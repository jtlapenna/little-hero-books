## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid client credentials"**
- Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct

- Update the token in your environment variables

**"Order not found"**
- Check that the order ID is correct
- Verify the order exists in your seller account
- Ensure the order is from the correct marketplace

**"Customization data missing"**
- Verify your Amazon Custom listing fields
- Check that customers filled out all required fields
- Review the customization parsing logic

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG_MODE=true
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

This will provide detailed logs for troubleshooting.

## üìä Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track

- **Order Processing Time**: Average time from order to fulfillment
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of orders processed successfully
- **Error Rate**: Frequency and types of errors
- **API Response Times**: SP-API call performance

### Health Checks

- Middleware health: `GET /health`
- Order processing status: Check order status map
- Renderer service status: `GET http://localhost:8787/health`

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use secure secret management in production
   - Rotate credentials regularly

2. **API Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

3. **Data Privacy**
   - Handle customer data according to privacy laws
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Secure data transmission and storage
