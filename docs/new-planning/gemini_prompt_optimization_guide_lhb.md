# üé® Gemini Prompt Optimization Guide
## Character Pose Generation & Appearance Consistency

> Working notes for Little Hero Books ‚Äì improving 12-pose consistency and locking character appearance.

---

## üß≠ Principles
1) **Image > Text.** Provide visual control sources in a strict order.
2) **Determinism where possible.** Same parts, same order, same settings.
3) **One change per test.** Measure, keep wins, revert losses.
4) **Short, unambiguous language.** Avoid poetic phrasing.
5) **Audit everything.** Hashes for inputs/outputs; record config.

---

## üì¶ Standard Parts Order (every call)
1. **STYLE_BOARD** ‚Äî a style sheet image that defines line weight, palette, textures, and rendering style.
2. **BASE_CHARACTER** ‚Äî the child‚Äôs locked appearance reference (frontal or neutral angle), generated earlier for this characterHash.
3. **HAIR_CHIP** ‚Äî a cropped patch with the exact hairstyle silhouette in opaque mass (no flyaway gaps); use same hair chip across all poses.
4. **POSE_REF** ‚Äî the pose-only reference (no clothing or identity cues); can be line art or silhouette.
5. **TEXT** ‚Äî minimal instruction to combine A (appearance) with B (pose).

> **Always keep this order** to help the model resolve conflicts consistently.

---

## üß± System Prompt (fixed across all 12 poses)
**Role:** You are a rendering assistant. Combine APPEARANCE (A) with POSE (B) without changing A.

**Rules:**
- A = appearance (face, hair, skin tone, clothing colors & logos, proportions, style) from STYLE_BOARD + BASE_CHARACTER + HAIR_CHIP.
- B = body posture and limb orientation from POSE_REF only.
- If A and B conflict, **follow A** and reinterpret B‚Äôs limb orientation to match A‚Äôs anatomy.
- **Do not change** hair silhouette, facial features, clothing logos or colors.
- Output: a single, front-lit illustration in the STYLE_BOARD style. Clean alpha, **no halo/pinholes** in hair; opaque hair mass.

---

## üß¨ Trait Manifest (embed in User text)
Provide a compact, machine-readable block to ‚Äúlock‚Äù traits. Include a checksum for BASE_CHARACTER so the model treats A as authoritative.

```json
TRAIT_MANIFEST = {
  "character_hash": "{characterHash}",
  "base_image_sha256": "{baseSha256}",
  "hair": {"style": "{hairStyle}", "color": "{hairColor}", "silhouette": "opaque_mass"},
  "skin_tone": "{skinTone}",
  "eyes": {"color": "{eyeColor}", "shape": "{eyeShape}"},
  "clothes": {"top": "{topDesc}", "bottom": "{bottomDesc}", "palette": "{palette}"},
  "style": {"line": "{lineWeight}", "texture": "paper_grain", "palette": "warm_muted"}
}
```

Keep the object small and consistent. The goal is signaling, not verbosity.

---

## üó£Ô∏è User Prompt Template (per pose)
**Context images in order:** STYLE_BOARD, BASE_CHARACTER, HAIR_CHIP, POSE_REF

**Text:**
```
Use A (appearance) from STYLE_BOARD + BASE_CHARACTER + HAIR_CHIP.
Use B (pose) from POSE_REF.

Follow TRAIT_MANIFEST exactly. Do not add or remove accessories. Do not change hair silhouette or clothing palette. If B conflicts with A, keep A and reinterpret B.

Render a single child in the STYLE_BOARD style, clean alpha, solid hair silhouette (no gaps), no background elements, no text.

[Insert TRAIT_MANIFEST JSON here]
```

**Final reinforcement (last lines):**
- ‚ÄúDo not modify hair silhouette.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDo not modify facial features.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúDo not modify clothing colors or logos.‚Äù

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Generation Config Recommendations
- **Temperature:** 0.15 (lower if residual drift persists; try 0.1).
- **Top-P/Top-K:** keep defaults unless drift persists, then lower Top-P modestly.
- **Size:** 1024√ó1024 or your production size; keep constant.
- **Safety filters:** standard; avoid aggressive auto-cropping.
- **Retries:** if pose ignored, retry once with an overlaid minimal ‚Äúpose skeleton‚Äù reference.
- **Serialization:** run poses sequentially to avoid cross-run variability.

---

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Hair Silhouette Strategy
- Create a **HAIR_CHIP** PNG with clean, closed silhouette (no wisps).
- Enforce opaque mass in System + User text.
- Prefer frontal/¬æ angle for BASE_CHARACTER so silhouette maps well across poses.
- Export with transparency and test Bria background removal; iterate until ‚Äúno pinholes.‚Äù

---

## ü§∏ Pose Consistency Strategy
- Pose refs are **style-aligned**: simplified anatomy, same proportions as BASE_CHARACTER.
- If certain poses drift, add a light pose skeleton overlay.
- Teach the model ‚Äúpose grammar‚Äù: head tilt, shoulders, hips, weight distribution.
- Keep **A-B-A sandwich** test variant (BASE ‚Üí POSE ‚Üí BASE) only if it shows measurable gain.

---

## üî¨ Test Plan (one variable at a time)
1. Add HAIR_CHIP + System rules ‚Üí measure hair alpha cleanliness (pinholes, halos).
2. Add explicit negatives (‚Äúdo not borrow style from B‚Äù) ‚Üí measure appearance drift.
3. Add Trait Manifest with checksum ‚Üí measure face/clothes stability.
4. Lower temperature to 0.10 if needed ‚Üí measure overall variance.
5. Optional: A-B-A sandwich or pose skeleton overlays ‚Üí keep only if net-positive.

**Metrics:** per-pose pass/fail on (a) hair alpha, (b) pose match, (c) face/clothes lock. Track with your existing auditing (hashes + config).

---

## üß∞ n8n Wiring Hints
- Keep a **fixed parts array** for every Gemini call; never vary order.
- Serialize poses (SplitInBatches = 1) + small Wait between calls.
- Compute `baseSha256` of BASE_CHARACTER and inject into TRAIT_MANIFEST.
- Log generationConfig alongside A/B hashes per pose.
- On retry, reduce temperature by 0.05 and add pose skeleton overlay.

## üö¶ Prioritized Implementation Order (one step at a time)

> **Always run poses sequentially (serialized) for every test run.** Keep all other variables fixed between steps.

1) **Serialize All Pose Calls (Baseline lock)**
   - **Change:** SplitInBatches=1, add 250‚Äì500ms Wait between pose calls, identical generation config for all 12.
   - **Goal:** Remove concurrency variance; establish a clean baseline set.
   - **Success metric:** Stdev of color histograms and face-embedding distance drops vs. prior runs; fewer random misses.
   - **Rollback:** Keep permanently if neutral/positive.

2) **Explicit Negatives for Pose Ref Bleed** *(no new assets)*
   - **Change:** Add end-of-prompt lines: ‚ÄúDo not borrow clothing/facial/hair details from the pose image.‚Äù
   - **Goal:** Stop appearance contamination from pose cards.
   - **Success metric:** Reduced clothing/face drift incidents across 12 poses.
   - **Rollback:** Revert if hair alpha regresses.

3) **Dynamic Pose Text per Pose Number** *(no new assets)*
   - **Change:** Load a concise ‚Äúpose grammar‚Äù description (hips/shoulders/weight/hand placement) from a 12-row table keyed by pose number.
   - **Goal:** Improve pose compliance while keeping appearance stable.
   - **Success metric:** Higher pose match rate, fewer limb/orientation errors.
   - **Rollback:** Remove if it introduces style conflicts.

4) **Trait Manifest + Base Image Checksum** *(text-only)*
   - **Change:** Inject small `TRAIT_MANIFEST` JSON (hair, skin, clothes, palette) with `base_image_sha256`.
   - **Goal:** Lock identity traits across poses.
   - **Success metric:** Near-zero trait deltas (palette/hair/face) across poses; lower embedding/HSV drift.
   - **Rollback:** Revert if it constrains pose adoption.

5) **Temperature Tighten** *(no new assets)*
   - **Change:** Lower temp from 0.15 ‚Üí 0.10.
   - **Goal:** Reduce residual stochastic drift.
   - **Success metric:** Fewer outliers without ‚Äúwooden‚Äù look; pose match maintains or improves.
   - **Rollback:** Restore 0.15 if characters feel too rigid or misses rise.

6) **A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA Sandwich (Experimental)** *(no new assets; per-pose override)*
   - **Change:** Order images as BASE ‚Üí POSE ‚Üí BASE for stubborn poses.
   - **Goal:** Further prioritize appearance while adopting pose.
   - **Success metric:** Net gain on targeted poses only; keep as a per-pose override.
   - **Rollback:** Use only where it helps.

7) **Retry Heuristic + Skeleton Overlay (Optional)** *(programmatic overlay; no new static assets)*
   - **Change:** On drift (hair alpha fail or pose mismatch), auto-retry once with a light pose-skeleton overlay and temp ‚àí0.05.
   - **Goal:** Salvage occasional misses without manual intervention.
   - **Success metric:** ‚â•70% of failed poses recover on first retry.
   - **Rollback:** Disable if it introduces artifacts.

8) **Hair Silhouette Hardening (HAIR_CHIP + Rules)** *(first step that requires new asset)*
   - **Change:** Add HAIR_CHIP image (opaque, pinhole-free) + System rules: ‚Äúopaque mass, no gaps, no wisps.‚Äù
   - **Goal:** Zero background-removal artifacts.
   - **Success metric:** 12/12 passes for hair alpha (no halos/pinholes) after Bria.
   - **Rollback:** Remove only if it harms pose accuracy.

**Implementation note:** If you‚Äôre only passing one control image per call (BASE_CHARACTER via public URL), skip the Files API; otherwise, use Files API when reusing multiple images and you want lighter requests.
