## Page 1 â€” A Gentle Night (twilight)
It was a nice evening in **[Child's Hometown]**,

As they went outside, a soft voice said,  
*"You are very brave."*

## Implementation Notes (for your workflow)

- **Hero poses:** prioritize standing, walking, looking, reaching. Use **one** seated pose on the picnic page (Page 8) *or* keep standing everywhere for maximal reuse.  
- **Clues:** **footprints are now Easter eggs** - subtle, secondary elements that hint at the animal guide's presence without being the main focus.  
- **Animal variants:** provide **one hero-friendly pose** per animal for Page 13 (reveal); footprints throughout as subtle Easter eggs.  
- **Personalization:** weave `[Child Favorite Color]` into small accents (trail glow, snack, one flower patch, a shell). Add `[Child's Hometown]` for local connection.  
- **No complex compositing:** no reflections, silhouettes, or water ripples; avoid glassy surfaces and high-contrast shadows.
