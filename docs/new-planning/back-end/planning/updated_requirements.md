# Updated Requirements: Human-in-the-Loop Asset Review System

## Context & Clarifications

Based on discussion with Jeff on 2025-01-16, the following clarifications and requirements have been established:

### Stage Review Process
- **All 3 stages require human review and approval** (at least initially)
- Human receives notification → reviews → flags issues for revision
- Human or AI model revises → re-submits for approval
- Process repeats until approved, then moves to next stage
- No rollback capability in v1 (future feature)

### Asset Management
- **No versioning in v1** (future feature)
- **No downstream notifications needed** - assets are guaranteed to be updated and approved when they reach downstream processes
- Revision workflow automation can be added later if needed

### Implementation Approach
- Build backend UI/UX locally first
- Prepare for R2 storage, API, and n8n integration
- Update n8n workflows all at once after folder structure is finalized
- Focus on core functionality before adding advanced features

### Existing Infrastructure
- Jeff has existing file structure that needs to be updated for this new tool
- Need to make structure future-proof while maintaining compatibility
- n8n workflows will need updates to align with new structure

## Key Design Principles

1. **Human-Gated Quality Control**: Every stage requires human approval
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Failed reviews trigger revision cycles
3. **Future-Proof Architecture**: Designed to accommodate versioning, rollback, and automation
4. **Minimal Disruption**: Works with existing workflows while enabling improvements
5. **Local-First Development**: Build and test locally before cloud deployment

## V1 Success Criteria

- Human reviewers can efficiently review assets at each stage
- Clear approval/rejection workflow with revision cycles
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Persistent data storage with database integration
- Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- Email notifications for order status changes
- Asset validation and security measures
- Order history and audit trail tracking
- Seamless integration with existing n8n workflows
- Foundation for future automation and advanced features
- Maintains asset URL stability for downstream processes

## V1.1 Success Criteria

- Optimized performance with webhook retry logic
- Image optimization and CDN integration
- Comprehensive automated testing suite
- Enhanced user experience with notifications and loading states
- Health monitoring and system status checks
