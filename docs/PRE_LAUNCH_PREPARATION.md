# Little Hero Labs - Pre-Launch Preparation & Competitive Strategy

**Domain**: littleherolabs.com  
**Project Status**: Build Phase ‚Üí Pre-Launch ‚Üí Launch  
**Target Launch**: 6-8 weeks from workflow completion

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

We are launching **Little Hero Labs** in a competitive but viable market. Analysis shows 10+ direct competitors with established players (Wonderbly: ~$710k/month) and newer AI-driven entrants. Success requires executing on 2-3 key differentiators and launching with professional marketing from day one.

**Market Reality**: Crowded but profitable. Competitors with poor execution create opportunity for quality entrants.

**Our Edge**: Fast fulfillment + consistent quality + Amazon distribution + competitive pricing.

## üè∑Ô∏è Brand Transition: Little Hero Books ‚Üí Little Hero Labs

### Current Status
- **Domain Purchased**: littleherolabs.com ‚úÖ
- **Codebase**: Still references "Little Hero Books" throughout
- **Documentation**: Still uses "Little Hero Books"
- **Workflows**: Still use "Little Hero Books"

### Transition Priority
**NOT CRITICAL FOR IMMEDIATE LAUNCH** - Can launch with current branding in code/workflows and update post-launch. Priority is getting to market fast.

### What Needs Updating (Post-Launch)
- Amazon listing title and copy
- Product images and branding
- Website content
- Email templates
- Customer communications
- Code constants and documentation
- n8n workflow naming

**Recommendation**: Launch with "Little Hero Books" as product name, use "Little Hero Labs" as company name. Clean up codebase after first sales.
