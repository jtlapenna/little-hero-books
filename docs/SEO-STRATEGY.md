## 1) Goals, Guardrails, KPIs
**Primary goals (next 90 days):**
- Rank for intent queries like *personalized kids book, custom children’s book, name book gift*.
- Grow qualified sessions to landing page; convert to **Amazon clicks** and **email sign‑ups**.
- Establish topical authority around personalized children’s books (E‑E‑A‑T signals).

**Guardrails:** One‑page sites can be “thin.” We’ll ship a robust single page now, but structure it to split into multiple URLs later without breaking SEO (modular sections that can become standalone pages with 301s and canonical continuity).

**North‑star KPIs:**
- Organic sessions (non‑brand vs brand)
- CTR from organic → landing
- Email sign‑up rate (lead magnet)
- Amazon clicks (with **Amazon Attribution**) & conversion rate estimates
- Top 25 keyword positions & share of voice
- Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms

---

## 2) Information Architecture (One‑Pager Now → Multi‑Page Later)
**One‑pager sections (anchor links):**
1. Hero (value prop + primary CTA to Amazon)
2. How it Works (3‑step)
3. Personalization Options (swatches/variations)
4. Inside the Book (gallery)
5. Quality & Specs
6. Gifting Use‑Cases
7. Reviews/UGC (seeded)
8. FAQ
9. Email Capture (lead magnet)
10. About/Privacy/Contact (E‑E‑A‑T)

**Future URL plan (can split later):**
- `/personalized-kids-book/` (current home content)
- `/how-it-works/`
- `/personalization-options/`
- `/gallery/`
- `/gifts/` (birthday/holiday/grandparent)
- `/reviews/`
- `/faq/`
- `/print-quality/`
- `/privacy/`, `/terms/`, `/about/`, `/contact/`
- Programmatic later (see §10): `/personalized-ANIMAL-book/`, `/kids-name-book/NAME/` (quality‑gated)
- Future D2C: `/subscribe/`, `/account/`, `/checkout/` (noindex until live)

---

## 3) Keyword Strategy & Mapping
**Core head terms (home page targets):**
- personalized kids book, custom children’s book, name book for kids, personalized story book, custom storybook

**Mid/long‑tail (on‑page copy + FAQ + future clusters):**
- personalized book with child’s name; toddler name book; custom picture book 8.5x8.5; personalized birthday book; grandparent gift personalized book; AI personalized children’s book; custom unicorn/fox/panda/dino kids book; gift for 3‑year‑old/4‑year‑old; keepsake story book

**Synonyms/LSI to sprinkle naturally:** custom kids story, create your own children’s book, photo‑quality picture book, read‑aloud keepsake, Lulu printed children’s book

**Keyword map (one‑pager sections):**
- H1/Hero: *Personalized Kids Book* + supporting: *your child becomes the hero*
- How it Works: personalize in minutes; AI‑personalized; printed & shipped
- Options: hair/skin/hair style; favorite animal; name appears on pages
- Gallery: illustrated picture book; 16 pages 8.5" × 8.5"
- Gifting: personalized birthday/holiday book, grandparent gift
- FAQ: shipping/turnaround, ages, preview, privacy

---

## 4) On‑Page SEO Templates
**Title tag (≤60):** Personalized Kids Book — Your Child Becomes the Hero | Little Hero Labs  
**Meta description (≤155):** Create a custom 16‑page picture book starring your child. Add their name & look in minutes; printed 8.5" × 8.5" and shipped fast. Order on Amazon.  
**H1:** Turn any kid into the hero of their own story.  
**H2s:** How it works • Personalize their look • See inside • Quality & specs • Perfect gift • FAQ

**Image alt text examples:**
- "Personalized kids book cover with child’s name"
- "Custom children’s book inside spread with animal sidekick"
- "Hair and skin tone personalization options for storybook"

**Internal anchors (for sitelinks eligibility):** `/#how-it-works`, `/#personalization`, `/#gallery`, `/#gifts`, `/#faq`

---

## 5) Structured Data (JSON‑LD)
Include multiple schemas on the one‑pager:

**Organization:** name, logo, sameAs (IG/TikTok/Pinterest/Etsy), contactPoint.

**Product (Book placeholder):** Only if you show price/availability on your page. If checkout is Amazon‑only, keep Product minimal to avoid mismatch; focus on describing the *experience* (can include `isSimilarTo` with Amazon Store URL).

**FAQPage:** Mark up 4–6 FAQs that mirror content on the page.

**VideoObject:** For the 20‑sec demo loop (thumbnailUrl, uploadDate, duration, transcript).

**WebSite + SearchAction:** Helps brand query sitelinks search box.

**BreadcrumbList:** Even on one‑pager, future‑proof for multi‑page split.

---

## 6) Technical SEO & Performance Checklist (One‑Pager)
- Static render or SSR; avoid client‑only hydration for above‑the‑fold.
- Core Web Vitals: LCP image preloaded, responsive images (`srcset`, `sizes`).
- Minify + compress; lazy‑load below‑the‑fold media.
- Use clean URLs on future split; keep anchor IDs stable.
- `robots.txt` allow all; disallow future `/account/`, `/cart/`, `/subscribe/` until live.
- `sitemap.xml` with home now; plan child URLs later.
- Canonical tag self‑referential now; unique canonicals later.
- Open Graph + Twitter Cards with a text‑free hero image (per brand pref).
- Accessibility: semantic headings, alt text, focus states, sufficient contrast.
- Analytics: Google Analytics 4 + Google Search Console + Ahrefs tracking + event goals (see §9).

---

## 7) Content Plan for a Robust One‑Pager
**Copy blocks to exceed “thin” threshold (800–1,200 words total):**
- Value prop + specific benefits for parents & gift‑givers.
- Details of personalization reflected throughout art (not just name on cover).
- Printing quality (8.5" × 8.5", 16 pages), ages, read‑aloud tone.
- Trust/privacy/COPPA‑style assurance.
- Gifting scenarios with concrete examples (birthday, holidays, grandparents).
- 4–6 FAQs with concise, unique answers.

**UGC:** Drop 2–3 short quotes; add alt text; consider tiny headshots or initials.

**Video:** Autoplay muted loop under 20s; provide transcript for VideoObject.

---

## 8) Email Capture & Lead Magnet — SEO‑Friendly
- Offer: **Free personalized coloring page** with the child’s name.
- Delivery: instant email + hosted download page (`/printables/child-name-coloring/` later). For now, a generic thank‑you page with noindex.
- Use copy on page (indexable) describing the printable to add content depth.
- Tag subscribers by interest (animal pick, age) for later lifecycle.

**Form UX:** one field (email) + checkbox for consent; message about privacy.

---

## 9) Measurement & Amazon Hand‑off
- Use **Amazon Attribution** links for all on‑site CTAs to measure downstream sales. Append UTM to your on‑site link → route through Attribution link.
- Event tracking (Google Analytics 4 custom events):
  - `cta_amazon_click` (button id, section)
  - `email_signup_submit`
  - `video_hero_play_6s`
  - `anchor_nav_click` (which section)
- Set Goals: Amazon clicks, email signups. Create funnels (landing → CTA → offsite).
- Ahrefs: Track keyword rankings and backlink growth
- Google Search Console: Monitor search performance and technical issues

---

## 10) Future: Programmatic/Cluster SEO (Quality‑Gated)
**Do not mass‑publish on Day 1.** Build only when you can ensure helpful, unique pages.

**Cluster ideas:**
- **Animal‑specific pages:** `/personalized-unicorn-book/`, `/personalized-fox-book/` — include distinct art previews, unique copy, FAQs.
- **Use‑case pages:** `/personalized-birthday-book/`, `/grandparent-gift-personalized-book/`.
- **Age slices:** `/books-for-3-year-olds/` (advice + your product natively included).
- **Name pages (careful):** `/kids-name-book/alex/` — only if you supply unique imagery/snippets (avoid doorway duplication). Consider noindex until quality threshold met.

**Internal linking:** Home → these clusters via cards; breadcrumb + related links within clusters.

---

## 11) Off‑Page SEO & Link Building (Low‑Friction)
- **Creator bios & link‑in‑bio:** ensure your own domain link, not a linktree, on socials.
- **Etsy listing:** link back in "About" section (nofollow acceptable).
- **Press one‑sheet:** host a lightweight media kit (/press/ later) and pitch to parenting newsletters/podcasters; give them a unique discount or giveaway.
- **Pinterest:** Claim domain later; for now, ensure pins link to your domain (not only Amazon) to build equity.
- **Scholarship/charity angle:** donate a % to literacy orgs; secure .org mentions (genuine partnerships only).

---

## 12) E‑E‑A‑T & Compliance
- Add founder/brand story (parents building for families).
- Real contact email + mailing address (can be a PO box).
- Privacy/Terms with a kid‑safety paragraph. Minimal cookie use (Plausible).
- Display limited real testimonials/UGC with light verification.

---

## 13) Migration Plan (to D2C + Subscriptions)
- Preserve the home page URL; spin content into subpages; 301 anchors to new sections.
- Introduce `/subscribe/` (plan comparison), `/account/` (login) — **noindex** until populated.
- Add **Product schema** when pricing/checkouts are native; ensure consistency with visible data.
- For programmatic pages, generate **unique** images/captions; enforce min word count; interlink.
- Maintain Attribution on Amazon CTAs while you A/B test native checkout vs Amazon conversion.
