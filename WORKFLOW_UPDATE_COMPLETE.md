# Workflow Update Complete: Custom Character from R2

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. Using n8n's Built-in Merge Node
- **Type:** Merge (n8n-nodes-base.merge)
- **Mode:** Combine
- **Combine By:** combineByPosition
- **Purpose:** Combines the custom character (1 item) with pose references (5 items)
- **Inputs:**
  - Input 1: Character from "Load Custom Character from R2" (1 item)
  - Input 2: Poses from "Load Pose Reference" (5 items)
- **Output:** 6 items (character at index 0, poses at indices 1-5)

### 2. Added "Reorganize Merged Data" Node
- **Type:** Code
- **Purpose:** Extracts the character from index 0 and duplicates it across all 5 pose items
- **Functionality:**
  - Receives 6 items from Merge node
  - Extracts character binary from item 0
  - Converts character to base64
  - Loops through items 1-5 (poses)
  - Creates 5 output items, each with both `characterBase64` and `poseBase64`
  - Includes metadata from loop items

### 3. "Prepare Gemini Requests" Node
- Unchanged - continues to receive merged data with base64 images
- Gets `characterBase64` and `poseBase64` directly from JSON
- Maintains crystal-clear prompt structure

## 📊 Workflow Flow

```
[Initialize Pose Generation Loop] (5 items)
    ↓
    ├─→ [Load Custom Character from R2] (1 item) ──┐
    │                                               │
    └─→ [Load Pose Reference] (5 items) ──────────┬┘
                                                   ↓
                                    [Merge Character with Poses] (6 items)
                                                   ↓
                                    [Reorganize Merged Data] (5 items)
                                                   ↓
                                    [Prepare Gemini Requests]
                                                   ↓
                                    [Generate Character in Pose]
```

## 🎯 Why This Solution Works

1. ✅ **Standard n8n Merge Node** - Uses built-in functionality
2. ✅ **Simple "Combine By Position"** - Merges 1 + 5 = 6 items
3. ✅ **Clean Reorganization** - Code node extracts character and duplicates it
4. ✅ **No Parallel Execution Issues** - Merge node waits for both inputs
5. ✅ **Works with Cloudflare R2** - S3-compatible, no AWS-specific code needed
6. ✅ **Reliable Binary Access** - Direct access to binaries after merge

## 🔍 Debug Output to Check

When the workflow runs, look for:
1. **Merge node output** - Should show 6 items
2. **"Reorganize Merged Data" debug logs:**
   - Total items: 6
   - Character extracted with size
   - Each pose processed (5 poses)
3. **"Prepare Gemini Requests" debug logs** - Should show 5 items with both images

## 🚀 Expected Result

Gemini should now receive:
- **Image 1 (Character)**: The custom character from R2
- **Image 2 (Pose)**: The grayscale pose reference
- **Clear prompt**: Instructions to copy character appearance + pose structure

This approach uses standard n8n nodes and avoids AWS-specific SDK code, making it cleaner and more maintainable!
